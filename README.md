Aicsemi aic8800 Wi-Fi driver

## Disclaimer

The code placed under [`src`](src) folder is the unmodified driver release directly from Aicsemi, the wireless chip vendor.

Radxa did not develop this software, and will not support its usage on other hardware or Linux kernels.

We do accept PRs to fix issues with unsupported platforms, as long as the necessary changes are placed under [`debian/patches`](debian/patches) to not interfere with future code upgrades.
